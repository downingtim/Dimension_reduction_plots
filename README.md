The continuing advances of omic technologies mean that it is now more tangible to measure the numerous
features collectively reflecting the molecular properties of a sample. When multiple omic methods are
used, statistical and computational approaches can exploit these large, connected profiles.
Multi-omics is the integration of different omic data sources from the same biological sample. In
this review, we focus on correlation-based dimension reduction approaches for single omic datasets,
followed by methods for pairs of omics datasets, before detailing further techniques for three or
more omic datasets. We also briefly detail network methods when three or more omic datasets are
available and which complement correlation-oriented tools. To aid readers new to this area, these
are all linked to relevant R packages that can implement these procedures. Finally, we discuss
scenarios of experimental design and present road maps that simplify the selection of appropriate
analysis methods. This review will guide researchers navigate the emerging methods for multi-omics
and help them integrate diverse omic datasets appropriately and embrace the opportunity of
population multi-omics.
